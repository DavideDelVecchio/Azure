This example demonstrates how to create domain joined Linux VMs on Azure using Azure AD Domain Service. 

* azuredeploy.json deploys a single linux VM that is domain joined and Kerberos enabled
* azuredeploy_multivm.json deploys a set of VMs that are domain joined and Kerberos enabled
* once you have a set of VMs, you can follow the instructions in setupcloudera folder to set up a domain joined Kerberos enabled cloudera cluster
